__Summary__

We set out to build a BCI employing Bayesian prediction and classification of sensory anticipation. In addition, we discovered a Cybathlon BCI Race strategy that does not rely on any input, brain signals or otherwise, that consistently outperforms the world's best BCI racers.

## Introduction

The Cybathlon BCI Race is a novel game competition where contestants control an avatar that has four actions available: *jump*, *speed*, *slide* and *rest*. It differs from a traditional game in that choosing the correct action is trivial, but informing the game of the action you intend your avatar to perform is not, as players are only allowed to communicate through a brain-computer interface.

More specifically, box types directly correspond to the correct actions. For example, if an avatar continuously performs the *rest* action on a grey box, it traverses the box in roughly ??? seconds. If it continuously performs any other action, it instead traverses the box in ??? seconds. The colored boxes have similar characteristics, except for the fact that the bonus for choosing the correct actions is significantly higher there. An avatar that correctly performs the *slide*, *jump*, or *speed* action can traverse a box in a mere 2??? seconds.

Within the constraints set by BCI, contestants are free to use any input modality of their choosing. As simply subvocalizating commands typically does not yield great results, most contestants opt for a proxy instead. Buffer BCI**, the framework we based our implementation on, defaults to labels for imagined movement:

## Ideas

We first investigated the possibility of improving the Buffer BCI by changing the modality. We limited our search to tasks that modulate the alpha band, since these are the easiest to pick up using EEG [cit]. Sensory anticipation grabbed our attention because... both motor cortex somatosoric cortex [cit], contrast IM, to our knowledge no BCI using this
