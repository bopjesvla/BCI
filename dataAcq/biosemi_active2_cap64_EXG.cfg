# Biosemi Active2 specific channel information
# channel numbers for the different type groups are fixed:  
# 1-256:   EEG
# 257-264: EXG
# 265-27:  JAZZ 
# 274-280: AUX
# 281-312: AIB

# Write n=label to select hardware channel number n (starting from 1)
# and attach a label to it. This will show up in the Fieldtrip buffer
# and the GDF file.
# Currently, there is no check for double inclusion of channels.
# That is, if you define 1=FOO and 1=BAR, the first hardware channel
# will show up twice, with different names.
# Channels listed before the first [save] or [stream] line will be added
# to both saving and streaming selections. Write [select] to enable 
# selection for both saving and streaming.
