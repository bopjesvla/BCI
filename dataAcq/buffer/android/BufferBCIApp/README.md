# Dependencies #
This project depends on:
- BufferClient.jar from the BufferBCI project (https://github.com/jadref/buffer_bci/tree/master/dataAcq/buffer/java)
- The commons math3 (3.4) library
- The libmuseandroid.jar (Android API for Muse)
- MatrixAlgebra.jar (Extension of commons math3, another project in this git)
- support-annotations-22.0.0
- support-v4-22.0.0
- libmuse.so # android binary files

#Libraries#

Android studio is fussy about where different non-source files go.  Thus it must be that:

app/libs - contains java source libaries, i.e. .jar files
app/src/main/jniLibs -- contains java native libaries, e.g. libmuse.so 
app/src/main/assets -- contains raw asset files, e.g. save files, classifier files

# Packaging #
The bufferclientsservice.apk is generated by android-studio. Once all the libraries are imported the Gradle module app can be run to create the .apk files. They are located in the app/build/outputs dictionary.
